# To Do List

It is a Full Stack To Do List Web Application created using ReactJS, CSS, HTML in Frontend and NodeJS with Express library as Backend and MySQL as Database. 

# To use this app follow the below steps:

**Step 1:** First of all fork this repositoy and run `npm install` command which will install all dependencies and librarys.

**Step 2:** Then go to Frontend Directory then build the react app using `npm run build`.

**Step 3:** Then go to Backend Directory and run the SQL Initialize commands.sql file **(You need to have MySQL on you device)**.

**Step 4:** Now you need to set up the server and create a User for nodejs to access the database.

I have used below configurations. If you want to use you own configuration do not forget to **change `config/config.js` file.**
